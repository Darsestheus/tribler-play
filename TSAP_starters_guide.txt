Guide to get TSAP working

clone the repository recursively (so with submodules), you can also first clone it and then do git submodules init, git submodules update.

go in to the tribler-prototype repository:
cd tribler-prototype

start the build process, this will also change the tsap directory in the previous directory (it will add the libs and change some source files)
./build.sh

we can now work on the app with eclipse by importing existing android code in to the workspace
